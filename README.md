This is the final project for the Front End Development course @ CodersLab.

It is an application helping to create a weekly meal plan and grocery shopping list. 
Features planned for the future:
- possibility to count the macro ingredients of the daily/weekly plan.
- possibility to export the shopping list into Listonic App (TBD).
